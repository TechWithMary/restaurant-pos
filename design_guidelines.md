### Component Library

**Categories (Left Column):**

- Active state with primary color background
- Clear visual feedback for selected category

**Product Cards (Center Grid):**

- Sticky header with order total
- Scrollable item list with quantity controls
- Large circular +/- buttons (48px minimum)
- Price calculations clearly separated

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Category selection uses primary color prominence
- Product prices use success color for immediate recognition
- Order total uses larger typography and visual separation
- Critical actions (send to kitchen) use maximum visual weight

**Touch Optimization:**
- All interactive elements minimum 44px touch targets
- Generous spacing between clickable elements
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions

**Tablet Vertical Optimization:**
- Fixed three-column layout prevents horizontal scrolling
- Category and order columns have fixed widths
- Product grid scrolls vertically only
- Bottom navigation/actions remain accessible

**Language Considerations:**
- Spanish text properly spaced and sized
- Currency formatting follows Spanish conventions (â‚¬)
- IVA calculation clearly labeled and separated
- Professional restaurant terminology throughout
